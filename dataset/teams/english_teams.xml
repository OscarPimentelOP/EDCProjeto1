    <strStadiumDescription>The Emirates Stadium (known as Ashburton Grove prior to sponsorship, and as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Holloway, London, England, and the home of Arsenal. With a capacity of 60,704 it is the fourth-largest football stadium in England after Wembley Stadium, Old Trafford and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

In 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home stadium, Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council&#x27;s approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the &quot;biggest decision in Arsenal&#x27;s history&quot; since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million. The club&#x27;s former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.

The stadium has undergone a process of &quot;Arsenalisation&quot; since 2009 with the aim of restoring Arsenal&#x27;s heritage and history. The stadium has hosted international fixtures and music concerts.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 15 FA Community Shields, 1 League Centenary Trophy, 1 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and 1 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.

Herbert Chapman won Arsenal&#x27;s first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club&#x27;s kit. Arsène Wenger was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.

In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. In terms of revenue, Arsenal is the ninth highest-earning football club in the world, earned €487.6m in 2016–17 season. Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal&#x27;s fanbase is the fifth largest in the world. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth $2.24 billion.</strDescriptionEN>
    <strDescriptionDE>Der FC Arsenal (offiziell: Arsenal Football Club) – auch bekannt als (The) Arsenal, (The) Gunners (deutsche Übersetzung: „Schützen“ oder „Kanoniere“) oder im deutschen Sprachraum auch Arsenal London genannt – ist ein 1886 gegründeter Fußballverein aus dem Ortsteil Holloway des Nordlondoner Bezirks Islington. Mit 13 englischen Meisterschaften und elf FA-Pokalsiegen zählt der Klub zu den erfolgreichsten englischen Fußballvereinen.Erst über 40 Jahre nach der Gründung gewann Arsenal mit fünf Ligatiteln und zwei FA Cups in den 1930er Jahren seine ersten bedeutenden Titel. Der nächste Meilenstein war in der Saison 1970/71 der Gewinn des zweiten englischen „Doubles“ im 20. Jahrhundert. In den vergangenen 20 Jahren etablierte sich Arsenal endgültig als einer der erfolgreichsten englischen Fußballvereine, und beim Gewinn zweier weiterer Doubles zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts blieb die Mannschaft in der Ligasaison 2003/04 als zweite in der englischen Fußballgeschichte ungeschlagen. Zunehmende europäische Ambitionen unterstrich der Verein in der Spielzeit 2005/06, als Arsenal als erster Londoner Verein das Finale der Champions League erreichte.</strDescriptionDE>
    <strDescriptionFR>Arsenal Football Club est un club de football anglais fondé le 1er décembre 1886 à Londres. Son siège est situé dans le borough londonien d&#x27;Islington.

Arsenal participe au championnat d&#x27;Angleterre de football depuis 1919 dont il a remporté treize éditions, ce qui en fait le troisième club le plus titré d&#x27;Angleterre, ainsi que treize coupes d&#x27;Angleterre ce qui constitue un record (devant Manchester United, qui en a remporté 12). Sur le plan continental, les Gunners (en français : « les canonniers ») comptent à leur palmarès une Coupe d&#x27;Europe des vainqueurs de coupe obtenue en 1994. Deux fois finalistes de cette coupe des vainqueurs de coupe en 1980 et 1995, ils ont également atteint les finales de la coupe de l&#x27;UEFA en 2000, de la Ligue des champions en 2006 et de l&#x27;Europa League en 2019.

Résident dès 1913 du stade de Highbury, situé dans un quartier du nord de Londres, le club s’est installé en 2006 dans une nouvelle enceinte de 60 355 places : l&#x27;Emirates Stadium, situé à Ashburton Grove. Arsenal nourrit une certaine rivalité avec les nombreux autres clubs de la capitale, mais celle l&#x27;opposant à Tottenham Hotspur, avec qui il dispute chaque année le « North London derby » est particulièrement ancienne et profonde.

Le club est dirigé par Chips Keswick (en) qui succède pour raisons de santé en juin 2013 à Peter Hill-Wood, fils et petit-fils des anciens présidents Denis et Samuel Hill-Wood. Il remplace son père à la mort de ce dernier, en 1982, après vingt ans de responsabilités. Son entraîneur depuis le 29 novembre 2019 est le Suédois Fredrik Ljungberg, ancien joueur du club, après le limogeage de l’Espagnol Unai Emery. Cependant le 20 décembre 2019, l&#x27;Espagnol Mikel Arteta, lui aussi ancien joueur du club, est nommé entraîneur. Il était avant sa nomination l&#x27;assistant de Pep Guardiola à Manchester City</strDescriptionFR>

    <strDescriptionIT>L&#x27;Arsenal Football Club, noto semplicemente come Arsenal, è una società calcistica inglese con sede a Londra, più precisamente nel quartiere di Holloway, nel borgo di Islington.[3]

Fondato nel 1886, è uno dei quattordici club che rappresentano la città di Londra a livello professionistico,[4] nonché uno dei più antichi del Paese. Milita nella massima serie del calcio inglese ininterrottamente dal 1919-1920, risultando quindi la squadra da più tempo presente in First Division/Premier League. È la prima squadra della capitale del Regno Unito per successi sportivi e, in ambito federale, la terza dopo Manchester United e Liverpool, essendosi aggiudicata nel corso della sua storia tredici campionati inglesi, dodici FA Cup (record di vittorie, condiviso con il Manchester United), due League Cup e quattordici Community Shield (una condivisa),[5] mentre in ambito internazionale ha conquistato una Coppa delle Coppe ed una Coppa delle Fiere. Inoltre è una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]

I colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno subìto variazioni più o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni. Anche la sede del club è stata cambiata più volte: inizialmente la squadra giocava a Woolwich, ma nel 1913 si spostò all&#x27;Arsenal Stadium, nel quartiere di Highbury; dal 2006 disputa invece le sue partite casalinghe nel nuovo Emirates Stadium. Lo stemma è stato modificato ripetutamente, ma al suo interno è sempre comparso almeno un cannone. Proprio per questo motivo i giocatori ed i tifosi dell&#x27;Arsenal sono spesso soprannominati Gunners (in italiano &quot;cannonieri&quot;).

L&#x27;Arsenal conta su una schiera di tifosi molto nutrita, distribuita in ogni parte del mondo. Nel corso degli anni sono sorte profonde rivalità con i sostenitori di club concittadini, la più sentita delle quali è quella con i seguaci del Tottenham Hotspur, con i quali i Gunners giocano regolarmente il North London derby.[7] L&#x27;Arsenal è anche uno dei club più ricchi del mondo, con un patrimonio stimato di 1,3 miliardi di dollari, secondo la rivista Forbes nel 2014, facendone il quinto club più ricco del pianeta e il secondo in Inghilterra.[8]</strDescriptionIT>

    <strDescriptionES>El Arsenal Football Club (pronunciación en inglés: /ˈɑː(ɹ)sənəl ˈfʊtˌbɔl klʌb/) es un club de fútbol profesional con sede en Holloway, Londres, Inglaterra, que juega en la máxima categoría del fútbol de ese país, la Premier League. Uno de los más laureados del fútbol inglés, ha ganado 43 títulos en su país, incluyendo 13 campeonatos de liga y un récord de 13 Copas de Inglaterra; también ha ganado dos títulos internacionales: la Copa europea de Ferias en 1970 y la Recopa de Europa en 1994.

Fundado en 1886 en el sudeste de Londres, en 1893, se convirtió en el primer club del sur de Inglaterra en unirse a la Football League. Ganó sus primeros títulos —cinco ligas y dos FA Cups— en los años 1930. Luego de un período de escasez en los años posteriores a la Segunda Guerra Mundial, se convirtió en el segundo club del siglo XX en ganar el doblete, obteniendo el Campeonato de Liga y la FA Cup de la temporada 1970-71. Los logros siguieron en los años 1990 y 2000. Durante esos años, Arsenal ganó un doblete de copas nacionales, dos dobletes de Liga y Copa, y dos bicampeonatos de la Copa de Inglaterra. Finalizó una temporada de Liga invicto y se convirtió en el primer club de Londres en llegar a la final de la Liga de Campeones de la UEFA.

Los colores tradicionales del club, el blanco y el rojo, han evolucionado con el tiempo. Del mismo modo, fue cambiando la ubicación del club; fundado en el distrito de Woolwich, en el sureste de Londres, en 1913 se mudó al norte de Londres, más exactamente en el distrito de Highbury, donde fue establecido el Arsenal Stadium, que funcionó hasta 2006, donde se hizo un traslado más corto, hacia los alrededores de Holloway, donde se levantó el actual Emirates Stadium. La estadía histórica del Arsenal en el norte de Londres, ha creado con el tiempo una fuerte rivalidad con el Tottenham Hotspur, conocida como el Derbi del Norte de Londres.4​

Arsenal posee una de las aficiones más numerosas del mundo.5​6​7​ Según la revista Forbes, el club fue el quinto club más valioso del mundo en 2014, con un valor de 1300 millones libras.8​</strDescriptionES>

    <strStadiumDescription>Villa Park is a football stadium in the district of Witton, Birmingham, England, with a seating capacity of 42,682. It has been the home of Aston Villa Football Club since 1897. The team previously played at Aston Park from 1874 to 1876 and Wellington Road from 1876 to 1897. The ground is less than a mile from both Witton and Aston railway stations and has hosted sixteen England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. It was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park has hosted more FA Cup semi-finals than any other stadium, having hosted 55 matches in total.

In 1897 Aston Villa moved into the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a Victorian amusement park situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home. Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,682 to approximately 50,000.

Before 1914 a cycling track ran around the perimeter of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was unavailable due to it staging the final of the Olympic football tournament.</strStadiumDescription>

Their traditional badge is of a rampant gold lion on a light blue background with the club&#x27;s motto &quot;Prepared&quot; underneath; a modified version of this was adopted in 2007.</strDescriptionEN>

The first ever league game was against Doncaster Rovers, who were also the opponents in the last ever game played at Brighton&#x27;s former stadium, the Goldstone Ground, 14 years earlier.

In May 2013 it was announced that the stadium would host games during the 2015 Rugby World Cup.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club is an English football club based in the coastal city of Brighton &amp; Hove, East Sussex. It is often referred to just as Brighton. They currently play in the Football League Championship, the second tier of the English football league system.

The team is nicknamed the &quot;Seagulls&quot; or &quot;Albion&quot;. The team has historically played in blue and white stripes, though this changed to all white briefly in the 1970s and again to plain blue during the club&#x27;s most successful spell in the 1980s. Crystal Palace is considered the club&#x27;s main rival, although the grounds are 40 miles apart.

Founded in 1901, Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League before being elected to the Football League in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the First Division and reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the top division in the same season. Mismanagement brought Brighton close to relegation from the Football League to the Conference which they narrowly avoided in 1997 and 1998. A boardroom takeover saved Brighton from liquidation, and following successive promotions they returned to the second tier of English football in 2002 and have played in the second and third tiers ever since.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Turf Moor is a football stadium in Burnley, Lancashire, England. It is the home ground of Premier League side Burnley Football Club, who have played there since moving from its Calder Vale ground in 1883. The stadium, which is situated on Harry Potts Way, named so after the club&#x27;s longest serving Manager, has a capacity of 21,401, all seated. It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players&#x27; tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the &quot;Star&quot; stand was erected and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.

Burnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883, losing 3–6 to local side Rawtenstall. When Prince Albert Victor opened a new hospital in Burnley in 1886, Turf Moor became the first football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family. The first Football League match at the ground took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship fixtures.

In 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing £20 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players&#x27; entrance tunnel, have been put on hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.

After again achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2014 further Ground renovations were undertaken to comply with new regulations include housing for International Media, relocation of the players tunnel and upgrades to seating in the David Fishwick Stand for away supporters. On 26 June 2014 the club unveiled a planning application for extensions to the Turf Moor front entrance including the rebuilding of the official Club Shop containing a first floor museum.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Burnley Football Club /ˈbɜrnli/ are a professional football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, who play in the Premier League, the highest level of English football. Nicknamed The Clarets, due to the dominant colour of their home shirts, they were one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted in 1910 in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, Aston Villa. It was thought the colours might lift and inspire Burnley to emulate the aforementioned side. Their home ground since 1883 has been Turf Moor.

Burnley have been Football League Champions twice, in 1920–21 and 1959–60, and have won the FA Cup once, in 1914. The Clarets also reached the 1961 quarter-finals of the European Cup. They are one of only three teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Preston North End.

The club spent most of their early history in England&#x27;s top two divisions, but remained outside the top flight from 1976 to 2009. From 1985 to 1992 they had a seven-year spell in the lowest tier of the Football League. In 1987 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference. Between 2000 and 2009 they played in the second tier of English football, until they gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time in 33 years after winning the 2009 Championship play-off final, but were relegated after a single season. The club currently play in the Premier League again in 2014–15 after being promoted from the Football League Championship at the end of the 2013–14 season as runners-up to Leicester City.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Stamford Bridge (/ˈstæm.fərd ˈbrɪdʒ/) is a football stadium located in Fulham, London. It is the home ground of Chelsea F.C.. The stadium is located within the Moore Park Estate also known as Walham Green and is often referred to as simply The Bridge.

    <strDescriptionEN>Chelsea Football Club /ˈtʃɛlsiː/ are a professional football club based in Fulham, London, who play in the Premier League, the highest level of English football. Founded in 1905, the club have spent most of their history in the top tier of English football. The club&#x27;s home ground is the 41,837-seat Stamford Bridge stadium, where they have played since their establishment.

Chelsea had their first major success in 1955, winning the league championship, and won various cup competitions during the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s and 2000s. The club have enjoyed their greatest period of success in the past two decades, winning 15 major trophies since 1997. Domestically, Chelsea have won four league titles, seven FA Cups, four League Cups and four FA Community Shields, while in continental competitions they have won two UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cups, one UEFA Super Cup, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Champions League. Chelsea are the only London club to win the UEFA Champions League, and one of four clubs, and the only British club, to have won all three main UEFA club competitions.

Chelsea&#x27;s regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. The club&#x27;s crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand the club and modernise its image. The current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced in the early 1950s. The club have sustained the fifth highest average all-time attendance in English football. Their average home gate for the 2012–13 season was 41,462, the sixth highest in the Premier League. Since July 2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. In April 2013 they were ranked by Forbes Magazine as the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at £588 million ($901 million), an increase of 18% from the previous year.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Selhurst Park is an association football stadium located in the London suburb of South Norwood in the Borough of Croydon. It is the current home ground of Crystal Palace Football Club playing in the Premier League.

In 1922 the site, a former brickfield, was bought from the Brighton Railway Company for £2,570. The stadium (designed by Scottish stadium architect Archibald Leitch) was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30,000, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 30 August 1924. There was then only one stand (the present Main Stand), but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played Sheffield Wednesday and lost 0–1 in front of 25,000 fans.

Two years later, in 1926, England played Wales in an international at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s) and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.

In 1953, the stadium&#x27;s first floodlights were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand, but were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on, pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof. Real Madrid marked the occasion by playing the first game under the new set of bulbs – a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was Real&#x27;s first ever match in London.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Crystal Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club&#x27;s initial nickname, &quot;The Glaziers&quot;. Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.

In 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to &quot;The Eagles&quot; and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between 1989–91 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990–1991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1–0 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.

Crystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, with whom they have contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club&#x27;s kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current player of the year is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club&#x27;s longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club&#x27;s top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer fee received has been for Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in January 2013.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Goodison Park is a football stadium located in Walton, Liverpool, England. The stadium has been home to Premier League club Everton F.C. since its completion in 1892 and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest purpose-built football grounds. The stadium is built in a residential area served by regular rail and bus services two miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre.

Goodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 39,572. Everton fans refer to the stadium as &quot;The Grand Old Lady&quot; and the abridged &quot;Goodison&quot;.

It has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England. Goodison has hosted the maximum number of league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton have remained in the top tier of English football since 1954. The club has only been outside the top division for four seasons, having only been relegated twice (in 1930 and 1951).

As well as hosting Everton games, the stadium has been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including several in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The record for the highest attendance in women&#x27;s football was set at Goodison Park in 1920, which stood for 92 years until 31 July 2012. This game&#x27;s high attendance resulted in women&#x27;s football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men&#x27;s game.

Goodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board grappled to control the destiny of the club. A split emerged with the members with the majority leaving their home at Anfield forming Goodison Park. Everton F.C.&#x27;s relocation to Goodison Park was one of the earliest cases of a team moving to a new stadium for monetary benefit.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Everton Football Club /ˈɛvərtən/ are an English professional football club based in Liverpool, and currently playing in the Premier League. The club have competed in the top division for a record 110 seasons (missing only four seasons, in the second tier) and have won the League Championship nine times.

Formed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first league championship two seasons later. Following four league titles and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period until a revival in the 1960s which saw the club win two league championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championship successes, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The club&#x27;s most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup. The club&#x27;s supporters are known as Evertonians.

Everton have a rivalry with neighbours Liverpool and the two sides contest the Merseyside derby. The club have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, after moving from Anfield after a row over its rent.

The club&#x27;s home colours are royal blue shirts and white shorts. Everton player Dixie Dean scored a record 60 league goals in the 1927–28 season.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strDescriptionEN>Fulham Football Club is a professional football club based in Fulham, London, England. They currently compete in the Premier League, the highest level of English football. Founded in 1879, they are the oldest football club from London to play in the Football League.

The club has spent 27 seasons in English football&#x27;s top division, the majority of these seasons coming in two spells during the 1960s and 2000s. The latter spell was associated with former chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed, after the club had climbed up from the fourth tier in the 1990s. Fulham have reached two major finals: in 1975, as a Second Division team, they contested the FA Cup Final for the only time in their history, losing 2–0 to West Ham United, and in 2010 they reached the final of the UEFA Europa League, which they contested with Atlético Madrid in Hamburg, losing 2–1 after extra time.

Fulham&#x27;s main rivalries are with fellow West London clubs Chelsea, Queens Park Rangers and Brentford. The club adopted a white shirt and black socks as the kit in 1903, which has been used ever since. 2019/20 Season (Promoted)</strDescriptionEN>

Previously, Elland Road was home to Holbeck Rugby Club and although used primarily for football since the early 20th century, rugby league returned when the ground was used by the Hunslet Hawks for several seasons in the mid-1980s. The stadium has hosted concerts, including performances from rock bands Queen, U2, Happy Mondays and more recently, the Kaiser Chiefs and Rod Stewart.

Elland Road comprises four main stands – the Revie Stand, the East Stand, the South Stand and the John Charles Stand– which, together with the corners, bring the total capacity to 37,890 The record attendance of 57,892 was set on 15 March 1967 in an FA Cup 5th round replay against Sunderland. This was before the stadium became an all-seater venue as stipulated by the Taylor Report and the modern record is 40,287 for a Premiership match against Newcastle United on 22 December 2001.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strStadiumDescription>Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, England which has a seating capacity of 45,276 making it the seventh largest football stadium in England. It has been the home of Liverpool F.C. since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of Everton F.C. from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent.

The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, Main Stand, Centenary Stand and Anfield Road. The record attendance of 61,905, was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report which greatly reduced its capacity.

Two gates at the ground are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. A statue of Shankly is situated outside the stadium. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.

It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen.

Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on Monday, December 8th, 2014.  This will increase the stadium size to around 55,000.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Liverpool Football Club /ˈlɪvərpuːl/ is a Premier League football club based in Liverpool. Liverpool F.C. is one of the most successful clubs in England and has won more European trophies than any other English team with five European Cups, three UEFA Cups and three UEFA Super Cups. The club has also won eighteen League titles, seven FA Cups and a record eight League Cups. In spite of their successful history, Liverpool are yet to win a Premier League title since its inception in 1992.

Liverpool was founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year. The club has played at Anfield since its formation. The most successful period in Liverpool&#x27;s history was the 1970s and &#x27;80s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to eleven league titles and seven European trophies.

The club&#x27;s supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, during which charging Liverpool fans caused a crush that resulted in a wall collapsing and the death of 39 Juventus supporters, after which English clubs were banned from European competition for five years. In the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing.

Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with neighbours Everton and with Manchester United. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964. The club&#x27;s anthem is &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>The City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England, currently known as the Etihad Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is the home of Manchester City and, with a domestic football capacity of 55,097, the sixth-largest in the Premier League and tenth-largest in the United Kingdom.

Built to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the stadium has since staged the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, England football internationals, rugby league matches, a boxing world title fight, the England rugby union team&#x27;s last match of the 2015 Rugby World Cup and summer music concerts during the football off-season.

The stadium, originally proposed as an athletics arena in Manchester&#x27;s bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, was converted after the 2002 Commonwealth Games from a 38,000 capacity arena to a 48,000 seat football stadium at a cost to the city council of £22 million and to Manchester City of £20 million. Manchester City F.C. agreed to lease the stadium from Manchester City Council and moved there from Maine Road in the summer of 2003.

The stadium was built by Laing Construction at a cost of £112 million and was designed and engineered by ArupSport, whose design incorporated a cable-stayed roof structure which is separated from the main stadium bowl and suspended entirely by twelve exterior masts and attached cables. The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades, including an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design and a special award in 2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design.

In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. The expansion was designed to be in keeping with the existing roof design.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Manchester City Football Club is an English football club based in Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark&#x27;s (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club&#x27;s home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923.

Manchester City entered the Football League in 1899, and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. It had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, which eventually saw them relegated as far down as third tier of English football by the end of the 1997–98 season. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group for £210 million and received considerable financial investment.

The club have won six domestic league titles. Under the management of Pep Guardiola they won the Premier League in 2018 becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first English men&#x27;s team to win the domestic treble. Manchester City&#x27;s revenue was the fifth highest of a football club in the world in the 2018–19 season at €568.4 million. 2019, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most valuable in the world at $2.69 billion, however the sale of a 10% stake in the club&#x27;s parent company City Football Group on 27 November 2019 for $500 million values them significantly higher.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Old Trafford is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United F.C. With a capacity of 75,635, Old Trafford is the second-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom after Wembley Stadium, and the ninth-largest in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram station.

Old Trafford, nicknamed the Theatre of Dreams by Bobby Charlton, has been United&#x27;s home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949, as a result of bomb damage during the Second World War, the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, which served to return the ground almost to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to over 90,000. The stadium&#x27;s record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.

Old Trafford has hosted FA Cup semi-finals, England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 and the 2003 Champions League Final, as well as rugby league&#x27;s annual Super League Grand Final and the final of two Rugby League World Cups. It also hosted football matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women&#x27;s international football for the first time in its history.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Manchester United Football Club is an English professional football club, based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester that plays in the Premier League. Founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, the club changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to Old Trafford in 1910. They are regarded as one of the most successful clubs in English football.

Manchester United have won the most League titles (20) of any English club, a joint record 11 FA Cups, four League Cups, and a record 20 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three European Cups, one UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club won a continental treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.

The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United was the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 28 major honours, and 38 in total, from November 1986 to May 2013, when he announced his retirement after 26 years at the club. On 19 May 2014, Louis van Gaal was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager after Ferguson&#x27;s successor David Moyes was sacked after only 10 months in charge, with the club&#x27;s record appearance-maker, Ryan Giggs, appointed as his assistant after a brief period as caretaker manager.

Manchester United is the third-richest football club in the world for 2011–12 in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of €395.9 million, and the world&#x27;s second most valuable sports team in 2013, valued at $3.165 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strDescriptionES>El Manchester United Football Club, mejor conocido como Manchester United, es un club de fútbol de la ciudad de Mánchester, Inglaterra, Reino Unido, que disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Old Trafford.

Nació bajo la denominación «Newton Heath LYR Football Club» en 1878, siendo el equipo del depósito ferroviario Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, ubicado en Newton Heath. El club se incorporó a la First Division en 1892. Tras estar cerca de la bancarrota en 1902, J. H. Davies tomó las riendas del club y cambió el nombre, llamándolo Manchester United. Su estadio fue bombardeado durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial lo que motivó al club a buscar la caridad de sus vecinos del Manchester City, quienes les permitieron jugar en Maine Road durante un tiempo a cambio de un costo anual. El United nombró a Matt Busby como entrenador del equipo tras la guerra y su política, por entonces inaudita, de la promoción de la mayor parte de los jugadores del equipo juvenil del club tuvo un gran éxito, al ganar la liga en 1956 y 1957.9 Este éxito tuvo un alto en el camino con el desastre aéreo de Múnich de 1958, en el que ocho jugadores del equipo perdieron la vida.10 11 A pesar de dicha tragedia, el conjunto supo recuperarse y ganó la liga en 1965 y 1967, así como la Copa Europea en 1968. El club no tuvo de nuevo un éxito tan notable hasta la década de 1990, cuando Alex Ferguson dirigió al equipo a la obtención de ocho campeonatos ligueros en once años. En 1999, el Manchester United se convirtió en el primer equipo inglés en ganar la Champions, la Premier League y la FA Cup en la misma temporada —el «triplete» del club—.12

Entre sus principales logros a nivel nacional se encuentran haber ganado la First Division/Premier League en 20 ocasiones, la FA Cup en 11 y la Supercopa de Inglaterra en 20, récords absolutos en los tres casos, además de cuatro ediciones de la Copa de la Liga de Inglaterra. A nivel europeo, ha obtenido tres veces la Liga de Campeones, empatado en séptimo lugar y segundo mejor inglés, además de una Recopa de Europa.13 Es el único club inglés en convertirse en campeón mundial de clubes, al conquistar la Copa Intercontinental en 1999 y la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA en 2008, tras derrotar a los entonces campeones de América Palmeiras y Liga de Quito, respectivamente.

Los principales rivales del Manchester United han sido el Liverpool y Manchester City, a quien se enfrenta en el derby de Manchester.

En la cultura popular, es considerado como uno de los más populares del mundo,14 debido a que cuenta con 659 millones de seguidores a nivel internacional hasta mayo de 2012, según una investigación realizada por la empresa Kantar. De esta cifra, 325 millones provienen del continente asiático, 173 millones del Oriente Medio y África, 90 millones de Europa y finalmente 71 millones de América. De igual manera, ha tenido el promedio de asistencia más alto en el fútbol inglés desde 1957, salvo algunas excepciones en que ha sido superado por el Tottenham, Everton y Liverpool.17

Financieramente, el United se convirtió en el primer equipo deportivo en superar un valor de 3 000 millones USD, para ser catalogada de esta forma como la franquicia deportiva mejor valuada del mundo, de acuerdo a la revista Forbes, un hito que sería superado un par de meses después por el también club de fútbol Real Madrid, con un valor de 3 300 millones USD. Hay que señalar que el club inglés encabezaba el listado de los equipos de fútbol más valuados del mundo desde 2004.</strDescriptionES>

    <strStadiumDescription>St James&#x27; Park is an all-seater stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It is the home of Premier League club Newcastle United F.C. and has a seating capacity of 52,405.

St James&#x27; Park has been the home ground of Newcastle United since 1892 and has been used for football since 1880. Throughout its history, the desire for expansion has caused conflict with local residents and the local council. This has led to proposals to move at least twice in the late 1960s, and a controversial 1995 proposed move to nearby Leazes Park. Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium&#x27;s asymmetrical stands.

Besides club football, St. James&#x27; Park has also been used for international football, it was used as a football venue for the 2012 Olympics, and will also be used as a rugby venue for the 2015 Super League Magic Weekend as well as the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In addition to professional football, the stadium has hosted charity football events and rock concerts, and been used as a set for film and reality television.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Newcastle United Football Club (often abbreviated to NUFC) is an English professional association football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne. The club was founded in 1892 by the merger of Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End, and has played at its current home ground, St James&#x27; Park, ever since. The ground was developed into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s and now has a capacity of 52,405. The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but two years of the competition&#x27;s history, and has never dropped below English football&#x27;s second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. In 2007, long term chairman and owner Sir John Hall sold his share in the club to Mike Ashley.

They have won four League Championship titles and six FA Cups, as well as the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Newcastle United has the ninth highest total of major honours won by an English club. The club&#x27;s most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles. The club is the twentieth richest club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating €115.3m in 2012. Historically, Newcastle’s highest placing was fifth in the world.

They have a fierce local rivalry with Sunderland, and the two clubs have engaged in the Tyne–Wear derby since 1898. The club&#x27;s traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their traditional crest takes elements of the city coat of arms, which features two seahorses.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Bramall Lane is a football stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is the home of Sheffield United. As the largest stadium in Sheffield during the 19th century it hosted most of the city&#x27;s most significant matches including the final of the world&#x27;s first football tournament, first floodlit match and several matches between the Sheffield and London Football Associations that led to the unification of their respective rules. It was also used by Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield F.C. for major matches. It has been the home of Sheffield United since the club&#x27;s establishment in 1889. It is the oldest major stadium in the world still to be hosting professional association football matches.

The stadium was built on a Sheffield road named after the Bramall family (who were file and graver manufacturers). The Bramalls owned &quot;The Old White House&quot; on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street, and subsequently built the Sheaf House, now a public house that still stands at the top of Bramall Lane. The stadium was originally opened as a cricket ground. It was also used for football games in the 19th century by Sheffield F.C. and Sheffield Wednesday but since 1889 it has been the home of Sheffield United.

Bramall Lane is one of only two grounds (the other being the Oval) which has hosted England football internationals (five games prior to 1930), an England cricket test match in 1902 against Australia and a FA Cup Final Replay in 1912, when Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion, 1–0. It also regularly hosted FA Cup Semi Finals and replays between 1889 and 1938.

The ground has also hosted rugby league games for the Sheffield Eagles, a Billy Graham Evangelist meeting in 1985 and a pair of rock concerts by Bruce Springsteen in 1988.

The record attendance for the ground is 68,287, set at an FA Cup 5th Round tie between Sheffield United and Leeds United on 15 February 1936. The ground has now been extensively renovated in the wake of the Taylor Report, and has an all-seated capacity of 32,702.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Sheffield United Football Club is a football club in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. They are currently in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield&#x27;s history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889.

Sheffield United won the League in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.

One of the founders of the Premier League in 1992, the club finished 14th in the inaugural season before being relegated the following year. The club returned to the Premier League in 2006 but were relegated in 2007. They reached the Championship play-off final in 2009 but were relegated to the third tier of English football in 2011.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>St Mary&#x27;s Stadium is a stadium in Southampton, England, which has been the home of an English Premier league club, Southampton F.C. since 2001. The stadium has a capacity of 32,505 and is currently the largest football stadium in the South of England (excluding London).
Since the 1980s, when Southampton regularly challenged the best sides in the English league (particularly in 1984 when they were league runners-up), there had been talk of the club relocating to a new stadium to replace The Dell due to the old stadium&#x27;s cramped location which made it unsuitable for major expansion work.

When the Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton&#x27;s directors initially decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.

After a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000 seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.

The move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary&#x27;s Church, as the football team of St. Mary&#x27;s Church Young Men&#x27;s Association before becoming Southampton St. Mary&#x27;s F.C., and eventually Southampton F.C.

Construction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the stadium itself and improvements to local infrastructure cost a total of £32 million.

The Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators – less than half the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on 1 August 2001 against RCD Espanyol, with the Spanish side winning 4–3.

The first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3–1 victory over Havant &amp; Waterlooville in the Hampshire Senior Cup final on 1 May 2002.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Southampton Football Club Listeni/saʊθˈæmptən, -hæmptən/ is an English football club, nicknamed The Saints, based in the city of Southampton, Hampshire, who currently compete in the Premier League.

The Saints&#x27; home ground since 2001 has been St Mary&#x27;s Stadium, before which they were based at The Dell. The club has been nicknamed &quot;The Saints&quot; since its inception in 1885 due to its history as a church football team, founded as St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Young Men&#x27;s Association (or St Mary&#x27;s Y.M.A) and has since generally played in red and white shirts.

The club has a long-standing rivalry with Portsmouth due to its close proximity and both cities&#x27; respective maritime history. Matches between the two sides are known as the South Coast Derby.

The club has won the FA Cup once in 1976, and their highest-ever league finish was second in the First Division in 1983–84. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on 15 May 2005 ending 27 successive seasons of top-division football for the club. The club eventually returned to the Premier League after a 7-year absence and have been playing there since the 2012–13 season.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is a stadium that will serve as the home ground for Tottenham Hotspur in north London, replacing the club&#x27;s previous stadium, White Hart Lane. It has a planned capacity of 62,062, making it one of the largest in the Premier League and the largest for a club stadium in London. It is designed to be a multi-purpose stadium and features a world&#x27;s-first dividing, retractable football pitch, that reveals a synthetic turf pitch underneath for NFL London Games, concerts and other events.

The construction of the stadium was initiated as the centrepiece of the Northumberland Development Project, intended to be the catalyst for a 20-year regeneration project in Tottenham. The project covers the site of the now demolished ground of White Hart Lane and areas adjacent to it. The project was first conceived in 2007 and announced in 2008, but the plan was revised several times, and the construction of the stadium, beset by disputes and delays, did not commence until 2015. The stadium is due to be completed during the 2018–19 season. The stadium is scheduled to open in 2019, with a ceremony before the first competitive game.

The name &quot;Tottenham Hotspur Stadium&quot; is a temporary name, the intention being to sell the naming rights to the stadium, so that it will be named after a sponsor. The stadium is occasionally referred to as New White Hart Lane by fans and some in the media.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club /ˈtɒt(ə)nəm/, commonly referred to as Spurs, is an English football club located in Tottenham, London, that plays in the Premier League. The club&#x27;s home stadium is White Hart Lane. Its newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield.

Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades – an achievement only matched by Manchester United.

The club&#x27;s Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: &quot;To Dare Is to Do&quot;), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby neighbours Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>The Hawthorns is an all-seater football stadium in West Bromwich,Sandwell, England, with a capacity of 27,000. It has been the home of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion F.C. since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. The ground was the last Football League ground to be built in the 19th century. At an altitude of 551 feet (168 m), it is the highest ground among those of all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs.
The expiry of the lease on Stoney Lane, as well as the club&#x27;s desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. All of Albion&#x27;s previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an &quot;out of town&quot; site on the borders of Handsworth. The area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the Hawthorns. The club signed a lease for the land on 14 May 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, Sandwell Park Colliery, and Albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in June 1913.

When opened, the Hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. The first match took place on Monday 3 September 1900, when Albion drew 1–1 with Derby County in front of a crowd of 20,104. Derby&#x27;s England international Steve Bloomer scored the first Hawthorns goal, with Chippy Simmons equalizing for Albion. The first Saturday game followed soon after, with Albion losing out 0–1 to fierce local rivals Aston Villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. The 1900–01 campaign was not a successful one however, as Albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to Division Two. Their defeat to Sheffield United on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the Hawthorns.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>West Bromwich Albion Football Club is an English professional football club based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England. They will play in the Premier League, the first tier of English football, at the start of the 2020–21 season. The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground, The Hawthorns, since 1900.

Albion were one of the 12 founding members of the Football League in 1888, the first professional football league in the world. The club have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football, where they have played for 81 seasons as of May 2020. They have been champions of England once, in 1919–20, and have been runners-up twice. Albion have reached ten FA Cup finals, winning the Cup on five occasions. The first win came in 1888, the year the league was founded, and the most recent in 1968, their last major trophy. They also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966. The club&#x27;s longest continuous period in the top division spanned 24 years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever spell out of the top division.

The team has played in navy blue and white stripes for most of the club&#x27;s history; and the club badge features a throstle perched on a hawthorn branch. Albion have a number of long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs, with their traditional rivals being Aston Villa and Wolves. Albion contest the Black Country derby with the latter.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>London Stadium (formerly and also known as Olympic Stadium and The Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park) is a multi-purpose outdoor stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in the Stratford district of London. It is located in the Lower Lea Valley, 6 miles (10 km) east of central London. It was originally constructed for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics—serving as the track and field venue, and as the site of their opening and closing ceremonies. Following the Games, the stadium was subsequently renovated as a multi-purpose stadium, with its primary tenant becoming West Ham United F.C.

Land preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008. The stadium held its first public event in March 2012, serving as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery. Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with a capacity of 60,000. The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial, with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun.

The stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, two England rugby league Test matches, and the 2017 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and 2017 World Para Athletics Championships (the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year). The stadium can also hold concerts with up to 80,000 spectators, and, due to its oval shape and relocatable seating, was deemed to potentially be suitable for other sporting events such as baseball and cricket.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>West Ham United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Upton Park, East London, England currently playing in the Premier League, England&#x27;s top tier of football. The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. In 1904 the club relocated to their current Boleyn Ground stadium. They initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before eventually joining the full Football League in 1919 and subsequently enjoyed promotion to the top flight for the 1923 season. 1923 also saw the club feature in the first FA Cup Final to be held at Wembley against Bolton Wanderers.

In 1940 the team won the inaugural Football League War Cup. The club has won the FA Cup three times: in 1964, 1975 and 1980 as well as being runners-up twice, in 1923 and 2006. In 1965, they won the European Cup Winners Cup, and in 1999 they won the Intertoto Cup. They are one of eight existent clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 55 of 87 league seasons in Division 1 to 2013. However, unlike the other seven (Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur), the club has never won the league title. The club&#x27;s best final league position is third place in the 1985–86 First Division.

Three West Ham players played significant roles in England&#x27;s victory in the 1966 World Cup final; captain Bobby Moore, and both goalscorers, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.</strDescriptionEN>

    <strStadiumDescription>Molineux Stadium (/ˈmɒlɨnjuː/ mol-i-new) is a Championship football stadium situated in Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, England. It has been the home ground of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club since 1889, and has a long and illustrious history as the first &#x27;new build&#x27; stadium in Football League history, one of the first grounds in the country to install floodlights, as well as hosting some of the first European club games in the 1950s.

At the time of its multi-million pound renovation in the early 1990s, Molineux was one of the biggest and most modern stadia in England, though it has since been eclipsed by many other ground developments. The stadium has however hosted England internationals and, more recently, England under-21 internationals, as well as the first UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Although currently a 31,000 seater stadium, the record attendance at Molineux stands at 61,315.

Initial plans were announced in May 2010 to rebuild two sides of the stadium by the 2014–15 season to increase capacity to around 36,000. The first stage of this project began in Summer 2011 and was completed on course for the start of the 2012–13 season. There are also provisional future plans for a longer term redevelopment of every stand that could potentially create a 50,000 capacity.</strStadiumDescription>

    <strDescriptionEN>Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club Listeni/ˌwʊlvərˈhæmptən/ (commonly referred to as Wolves) is an English professional football club that represents the city of Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. The club was originally known as St. Luke&#x27;s FC and was founded in 1877 and since 1889 has played at Molineux. They currently compete in the Football League Championship, the second highest tier of English football, having been promoted from League One in 2014 after a solitary season at that level.

Historically, Wolves have been highly influential, most notably as being founder members of the Football League, as well as having played an instrumental role in the establishment of the European Cup, later to become the UEFA Champions League. Having won the FA Cup twice before the outbreak of the First World War, they developed into one of England&#x27;s leading clubs under the management of ex-player Stan Cullis after the Second World War, going on to win the league three times and the FA Cup twice more between 1949 and 1960. It was during this time that the European Cup competition was established, after the English press declared Wolves &quot;Champions of the World&quot; following their victories against numerous top European and World sides in some of British football&#x27;s first live televised games.

Wolves have yet to match the successes of the Stan Cullis era, although, under Bill McGarry, they contested the first-ever UEFA Cup final in 1972 and won the 1974 League Cup, a trophy they lifted again six years later under John Barnwell. However, financial mismanagement in the 1980s led to the club&#x27;s very existence being under threat as well as three consecutive relegations, before a revival and back-to-back promotions under manager Graham Turner and record goalscorer Steve Bull saw them finish the decade in the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.</strDescriptionEN>
